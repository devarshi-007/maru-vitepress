## Introduction

- Sometimes, when the server goes down, all events generated by GitHub will not be caught. To synchronize that events, ERPNext-Projects-Plus has 3 options

1. CRON JOB - that will run every day at 2:00 AM
2. ERPNext-Projects-Plus Settings - that doctype has a button called Github Sync which will execute the syncing process between GitHub and EPP
3. you can manually run this command to synchronize data between GitHub and EPP.
```
bench execute erpnext_projects_plus.modules.github.webhook_sync.webhook_sync
```
