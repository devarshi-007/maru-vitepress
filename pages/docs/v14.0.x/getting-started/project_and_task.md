### Introduction

The "Project" is ERPNext doctype, which contains details about the project. And user can associate "Tasks" with that project

### Our goal
- Every task that generates has a name, we use that name in our GitHub commits and pull requests.
- When user authorize their organization in ERPNext-Projects-Plus, then application enables Commits and Pull Request tracking
- Whenever a user enters that name in commit or pr, it will associate with particular tasks.
